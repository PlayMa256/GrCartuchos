# Rewrite
This is a write of an internal system for a family business. The older version is 5 years old, written in plain php, it is a mess.  So i decided to rewrite this with a better ui and with a better business logic, my main point here is to be maintainable and easy to add more things.

And of course, since my mom manages the business, she would like to add more features to help her, but it is not possible to be done the way it is now.


## Backend
The backend is going to be rewrite using graphql + sequelize to manage the queries for the necessary tables. I'm reusing a TS + graphql project that i stated on a couse about graphql that i was taken. It is a good oportunity to exercise those concepts.
