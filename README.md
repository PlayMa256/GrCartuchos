# DEPRECATED
This project was created in the early stages of my career, while i was learning new stuff and how to do that. This is being stable for 5 years, but now it is time to move on. On branch v2.0.0 you will find a react + relay version with a java backend (**WIP**).

# GR Cartuchos
This project is an ERP (TS type) built to maintain a little family bussiness. It started when me (the developer) had a little experience
with OO programming and newer techs. Now, to fit the bussiness needs, its beeing rebuild (on 2.0 branch) with nodejs (express) + sequelize + socket.io.
